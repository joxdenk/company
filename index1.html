      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Our History</h4>
      <p>GlobaLink was launched with a vision in a time of difficulty. Established in late 2021 during the beginning of the great displacement in the world, we recognized that the demise of the for-sale residential market was going to expand the growth and demand in the residential rental market.

      Identifying this ensuing surge in this sector, GlobaLink created a multi-faceted platform to promote and support the multi-family investment market with an ever-growing range of services and geographic coverage.
      
      Today, GlobaLink's superior results are directly tied to our firm professionals' level of industry understanding, product focus, process efficiency, and daily work ethic. It is these attributes that were forged in our beginning and carried through to this day which are the critical keys to success in undertaking any project and delivering on every client need.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-info">Mission</h4>
